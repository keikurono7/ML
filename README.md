   - Each mapper processes a portion of the data (block) stored in HDFS.  
   - Output is a set of **intermediate key-value pairs**.

2. **Reducer**  
   - Takes intermediate key-value pairs as input.  
   - Groups data based on keys and performs **aggregation or summarization**.  
   - Produces the **final output** in the form of key-value pairs.

3. **Driver Program**  
   - Controls the entire execution of the MapReduce job.  
   - Specifies the Mapper and Reducer classes, input and output paths, and job configuration.

## üîÑ MapReduce Data Processing Flow

The **MapReduce data processing** workflow follows five key stages:

---

### üîπ 1. Input Data Splitting
- Input data stored in **HDFS** is divided into **fixed-size blocks** (commonly 128 MB or 256 MB).  
- Each block is processed by a separate **Mapper** task.  
- Example:  
  A 512 MB file is divided into 4 blocks ‚Üí 4 Mapper tasks.

---

### üîπ 2. Mapping Phase
- Each mapper processes its data block line by line.  
- It generates **intermediate key-value pairs** as output.  

**Example:**  
For a word count program, if the input text is:

Hadoop is powerful Hadoop is reliable

The mapper output is:

(Hadoop, 1) (is, 1) (powerful, 1) (Hadoop, 1) (is, 1) (reliable, 1)

---

### üîπ 3. Shuffling and Sorting Phase
- Hadoop automatically **groups and sorts** all intermediate key-value pairs by key.  
- This ensures that all values for the same key are sent to the same reducer.  

**Example:**  
After shuffling and sorting:

(Hadoop, [1, 1]) (is, [1, 1]) (powerful, [1]) (reliable, [1])

---

### üîπ 4. Reducing Phase
- Each reducer processes one unique key and its list of values.  
- Performs **aggregation or summarization** on the values.  

**Example:**  
Reducer output:

(Hadoop, 2) (is, 2) (powerful, 1) (reliable, 1)

---

### üîπ 5. Output Phase
- The **final results** are written back to **HDFS**.  
- Each reducer writes its output to a separate file, typically named `part-00000`, `part-00001`, etc.

**Example Output File:**

Hadoop 2 is 2 powerful 1 reliable 1

## üß© Example: Word Count Using MapReduce

### **Objective:**  
Count the frequency of each word in a text document.

| **Phase** | **Input** | **Output** |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Map** | Text lines | (word, 1) |
| **Shuffle & Sort** | Intermediate pairs | (word, [1, 1, 1...]) |
| **Reduce** | Grouped pairs | (word, total count) |

**Final Output Example:**

Big 3 Data 5 Analytics 2 Hadoop 4

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Internal Working of MapReduce

1. **InputFormat:**  
   - Splits data into logical input splits.  
   - Assigns each split to a mapper.

2. **RecordReader:**  
   - Reads data and converts it into key-value pairs for the mapper.

3. **Mapper Function:**  
   - Processes input and generates intermediate key-value pairs.

4. **Combiner (Optional):**  
   - Performs local aggregation before shuffling to reduce data transfer.

5. **Partitioner:**  
   - Determines which reducer will process a given key.

6. **Reducer Function:**  
   - Aggregates data from all mappers and generates final results.

7. **OutputFormat:**  
   - Writes reducer output to HDFS.

## ‚ö° Example Use Case

**Scenario:**  
An e-commerce company wants to analyze **customer clickstream data** (hundreds of GBs daily).

**How Hadoop MapReduce Works Here:**
1. **Mapper:** Reads web logs and emits `(product_id, 1)` for every product view.  
2. **Shuffling:** Groups all identical product IDs together.  
3. **Reducer:** Counts the total views for each product.  
4. **Output:** Produces the total product views for the day, stored in HDFS.

**Result Example:**

Product_101  15230 Product_202  18455 Product_303  9320

# 10. What is Hadoop? Explain why Hadoop emerged and its advantages over RDBMS.

**Q:** What is Hadoop?  

**A:** Hadoop is an open-source framework for storing and processing large volumes of data in a distributed computing environment. It allows for the scalable, reliable, and efficient processing of big data across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

**Q:** Why did Hadoop emerge?  

**A:** Hadoop emerged to handle the limitations of traditional RDBMS in dealing with:  
- **Volume:** Huge amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.  
- **Variety:** Different types of data like text, images, videos, logs, etc.  
- **Velocity:** Fast data generation requiring real-time or near-real-time processing.  
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Using commodity hardware for storage and processing large datasets.  

**Q:** Advantages of Hadoop over RDBMS  

1. **Scalability:** Can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster.  
2. **Cost-effective:** Uses commodity hardware rather than expensive high-end servers.  
3. **Fault tolerance:** Data is replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring reliability.  
4. **Flexibility:** Can store and process structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.  
5. **High throughput:** Optimized for batch processing of massive datasets.  
6. **Distributed computing:** Processes data in parallel across multiple nodes, reducing processing time.

# 11. Describe the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) architecture and its significance

**Q:** What is HDFS architecture?  

**A:** HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is a distributed file system designed to store large datasets reliably across multiple machines. Its architecture consists of the following main components:  

1. **NameNode:**  
   - Acts as the master node.  
   - Manages the filesystem namespace and metadata (file locations, directory structure).  
   - Keeps track of which blocks are stored on which DataNodes.  

2. **DataNode:**  
   - Acts as the worker/slave nodes.  
   - Stores actual data blocks.  
   - Handles read/write requests from clients.  
   - Reports block information periodically to NameNode.  

3. **Secondary NameNode:**  
   - Helps in checkpointing and reducing the load on the primary NameNode.  
   - Not a backup but assists in metadata management.  

4. **Blocks:**  
   - Files are split into fixed-size blocks (default 128 MB) and stored across DataNodes.  
   - Each block is replicated (default 3 copies) to ensure fault tolerance.  

**Q:** Significance of HDFS  

1. **Fault Tolerance:** Automatic replication of data ensures reliability even if nodes fail.  
2. **High Throughput:** Optimized for large files and batch processing rather than low-latency access.  
3. **Scalability:** Can easily scale to thousands of nodes to store petabytes of data.  
4. **Cost-effective:** Uses commodity hardware to store huge volumes of data.  
5. **Data Locality:** Brings computation to the data, reducing network congestion and improving processing speed.  
6. **Flexibility:** Can store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
